  <h2>Determine if a number is prime</h2>
  <p>
    Your task is to provide an implementation which will determine whether or not a given number is prime or not. In the
    case of numbers less-than or equal to one, you are expected to return false.
  </p>
  <p>
    Once you have implemented a solution, you can hit the <code>Check</code> button below to run your implementation
    against some unit tests provided by your trainer.

I started painting as a hobby when I was little. I didn't know I had any talent. I believe talent is just a pursued interest. Anybody can do what I do. Maybe there's a happy little bush that lives right there. I'm going to mix up a little color. Weâ€™ll use Van Dyke Brown, Permanent Red, and a little bit of Prussian Blue.

Let that brush dance around there and play. Use absolutely no pressure. Just like an angel's wing. We'll make some happy little bushes here.

Let's have a nice tree right here. In this world, everything can be happy. You don't want to kill all your dark areas they are very important. See how easy it is to create a little tree right in your world. We'll take a little bit of Van Dyke Brown. And I know you're saying, 'Oh Bob, you've done it this time.' And you may be right.

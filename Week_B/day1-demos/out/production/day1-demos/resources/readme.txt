It all happens automatically. A little happy sunlight shining through there. We're not trying to teach you a thing to copy. We're just here to teach you a technique, then let you loose into the world.

Here we're limited by the time we have. If you've been in Alaska less than a year you're a Cheechako. It's so important to do something every day that will make you happy.

Just let go - and fall like a little waterfall. Here's something that's fun. Every highlight needs it's own personal shadow. Making all those little fluffies that live in the clouds. There we go. These things happen automatically. All you have to do is just let them happen.

All you have to do is let your imagination go wild. A tree cannot be straight if it has a crooked trunk. Just relax and let it flow. That easy. Go out on a limb - that's where the fruit is. In your world you have total and absolute power. A beautiful little sunset.

Let's have a nice tree right here. Do an almighty painting with us. Let's do it again then, what the heck. We start with a vision in our heart, and we put it on canvas.

It's a super day, so why not make a beautiful sky? And just raise cain. Let's put some happy trees and bushes back in here.

Let's make some happy little clouds in our world. I thought today we would do a happy little picture. This painting comes right out of your heart. We spend so much of our life looking - but never seeing.

    The DOCTYPE directive should be the very first 
    non-comment line declared within our HTML documents 
    (even before the <html> tag).

    It is not technically a tag, but a directive, or an
    instruction to web browser about what version the 
    page is written.

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <!--
            <head>

                Contains information about the page, rather than
                the content shown (aka metadata). We can include 
                some information such as:

                    - <style>   : used to apply internal CSS styling to the webpage
                    - <link>    : used to link other resources to this document (external CSS)
                    - <script>  : used to write inline JS, which can make our webpage more dynamic/interactive
                    - <meta>    : used to provide search engine robots extra info about our page
                    - <title>   : determines the text on the tab in browser

            HTML tags/elements

                Used to indicate how content should be displayed. Usually will require an opening and a closing tag.
                Those that do not require lsing tags are known as "self-closing" tags.

                <p>     : paragraph
                <h#>    : heading 1-6
                <div>   : division/divider; used to group related elements together
                <img>   : image (self-closing)
                <a>     : anchor/hyperlink; used to create links to other webpages or to sections within the current page
                <br>    : line break (self-closing)
                <hr>    : horizontal rule (self-closing)
                <form>  : Similar to a div, but will encapsulate form elements/members
                <input> : Create a field for user input of some sort. (self-closing)

            
            Attributes

                HTML elements can have attributes, which provide additional information about the contents of an 
                element. They appear within the opening tags of an HTML element, and are amde of two parts: a
                name/key, and a value. The name and the value are separated by an equals sign and the value 
                of the attribute is encapsulated within double quotes.

        <h1>This is the main heading</h1>
        <p>
            This text might be used to introduce the rest of the page if the page is long enough.





            we can make use of subheadings to further
            organize our web page's content.
        </p>
        <h2>this is a sub-heading</h2>
        <p>
            I can't think of anything more rewarding than being able to express yourself to others
            through painting. This is truly an almighty mountain. Youc an create beautiful things
            - but you ahve to see them in your mind first. Work that paint. You can't have light
            without dark. You can't know happiness unless you've known sorrow.

        <h3>This is even smaller than the other headings...maybe to create nested content</h3>

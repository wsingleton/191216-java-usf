  <h2>First Task</h2>
  <p>
    Welcome to your first Java coding lesson! This course and its lessons are created using the IntelliJ IDEA integrated
    development environment (IDE) along with the EduTools plugin. On the left you will see the Task class declaration
    which contains some pre-written logic, but is missing something (as represented by the placeholder text) - which you
    will provide.
  </p>
  <p>
    Your first task will be to provide the correct String, <code>"Hello, world!"</code>, to the
    <code>System.out.println()</code>call.
  </p>
  <p>
    Once you have implemented a solution, you can hit the <code>Check</code> button below to run your implementation
    against some unit tests provided by your trainer.

    Ensure that you typed it <em>exactly</em> as it was stated in the instructions. Casing and punctuation (or lack
    thereof) must match!

  <h2>Determine minimum and maximum</h2>
  <p>
    Your task is to implement a solution which returns an array of two numbers. The contents of this array will
    represent the minimum and maximum values, respectively, contained within the provided array. If an invalid array is
    provided, your implementation should return an empty array.
  </p>
  <p>
    Once you have implemented a solution, you can hit the <code>Check</code> button below to run your implementation
    against some unit tests provided by your trainer.

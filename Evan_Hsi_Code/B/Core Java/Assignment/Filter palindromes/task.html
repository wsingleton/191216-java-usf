  <h2>Filter palindromes</h2>
  <p>
    Working with data sets and filtering information from them into a separate data set is, as has been discussed, quite
    common for a junior developer. This task serves to further strengthen your skills in this area.
  </p>
  <p>
    Your task is to filter out words which are palindromes (strings that are the same both backwards and forward) from a
    provided array of Strings. As a heads up, you should ignore capitalization, punctuation, and whitespace.  For
    instance, the phrase, "Do geese see God?", is a palindrome (when the three are ignored). Additionally, numeric
    palindromes are also tested for.

    Once you have implemented a solution, you can hit the <code>Check</code> button below to run your implementation
    against some unit tests provided by your trainer.

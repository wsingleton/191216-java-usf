  <h2>Reverse a string</h2>
  <p>
    As with most common code challenges, there are various libraries at your disposal which can quickly and easily
    accomplish the task at hand. However, a code challenge is not meant to test your ability to use pre-made tools and
    libraries, but instead tests your ability to solve a problem using your implementation.

    Your next task is probably one of the most commonly asked junior-level code challenges: reverse a string. Now, there
    are several variations of this question, each of which establish different constraints and allowances. For this
    task, you should reverse the provided string without using a temporary variable to store characters, nor should you
    use any native or third-party libraries to assist you with reversal (i.e. no using <code>StringBuilder</code> or
    <code>StringBuffer</code>!)

    Once you have implemented a solution, you can hit the <code>Check</code> button below to run your implementation
    against some unit tests provided by your trainer.

    Remember that data structures are often used to help us solve common problems. What data structure would be most
    useful for helping us reverse a string?

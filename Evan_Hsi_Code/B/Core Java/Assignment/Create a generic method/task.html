  <h2>Create a generic method</h2>
  <p>
    Polymorphism is one of the core pillars of object-oriented programming. It allows developers to reuse logic in
    various scenarios in order to reduce the overall number of lines of code.
  </p>
  <p>
    For instance, if you need to sort some things, why would you implement a different class for each and every type of
    thing you need to sort? Is the logic of sorting that much different from thing to thing? Isn't there a way that you
    can streamline this so that a single class can handle all cases?
  </p>
  <p>
    Well, in fact, there is: generics. Generics were introduced in Java 5 and are most commonly associated with the
    Collections API. This is appropriate since prior to Java 5, working with raw collections was cumbersome and
    error-prone. The introduction of this feature was a boon for Java developers, and greatly appreciated.
  </p>
  <p>
    Your task is to provide an implementation of a generic method, one that can work with any type and print out all of
    the items of a provided array (which could be an array of ints, Strings, etc.). Do not use overloaded methods, as
    this will not pass.

    against some unit tests provided by your trainer.

  <h2>FizzBuzz</h2>
  <p>
    The classic FizzBuzz challenge! This is an extremely common coding challenge which is given to junior developers to
    ensure that they have basic problem solving and programming language skills before hiring them.
  </p>
  <p>
    The task is to iterate across the provided array, and to populate - and return - an array of Strings based upon
    those values. If a number at a given index position is divisible by three, you should put the word "fizz" into the
    corresponding index position of the String array.
  </p>
  <p>
    Likewise, if a number is divisible by five, you should put the word "buzz" into the String array. If a number is
    divisible by both three and five, the word "fizzbuzz" should be placed into the array instead.
  </p>
  <p>
    Finally, if the number is not divisible by three nor five, you should simply put the
    String representation of the number into the String array.

    against some unit tests provided by your trainer.

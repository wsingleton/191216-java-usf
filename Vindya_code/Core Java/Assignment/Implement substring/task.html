  <h2>Implement substring</h2>
  <p>
    Not that you'll be frequently implementing String API methods by hand, but it is common to be asked to implement
    them in coding challenges.
  </p>
  <p>
    For this challenge: implement a substring method. The provided method signature takes in three arguments: the string
    from which substring shall be taken, the starting position of the substring, and the non-inclusive end of the
    substring.
  </p>
  <p>
    The only constraint of this task is that you <em>cannot</em> use the existing <code>substring</code>
    method belonging to the String API.
  </p>

    Once you have implemented a solution, you can hit the <code>Check</code> button below to run your implementation
    against some unit tests provided by your trainer.

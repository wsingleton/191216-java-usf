	/*Write a class named Assignment6 which creates a float variable x. Set x to some value.

        If so, print the message, “x is equal to 3”. Write an else-if statement to check if x is greater than 5, and, if so,
        prints the message, “x is greater than 5”. Write another else-if statement to check if x is less than or equal to 0.
        If so, it prints the message,

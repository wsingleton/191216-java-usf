11.	Write a class named Assignment11 that uses a double for-loop (a for-loop within a for-loop). T
        he outer loop should navigate through an integer array that has 10 elements corresponding
        to the numbers 1 through 10, inclusive. The inner loop should count from 1 to 10, and prints
        the value of the current count multiplied by a the current index of the array.
        You should end up printing the multiples of 1 through 10 from
        1 to 10. Ex: 1*1, 1*2, 1*3…1*10, 2*1, 2*2, 2*3…10*9, 10*10.

Trees cover up a multitude of sins. You can't make a mistake. Anything that happens you can learn to use - and make something beautiful out of it. But they're very easily killed. Clouds are delicate. The secret to doing anything is believing that you can do it. Anything that you believe you can do strong enough, you can do. Anything. As long as you believe. Everybody needs a friend. You've got to learn to fight the temptation to resist these things. Just let them happen.

You have freedom here. The only guide is your heart. I started painting as a hobby when I was little. I didn't know I had any talent. I believe talent is just a pursued interest. Anybody can do what I do. We'll do another happy little painting. Let your imagination be your guide.

This is the time to get out all your flustrations, much better than kicking the dog around the house or taking it out on your spouse. Sometimes you learn more from your mistakes than you do from your masterpieces. You could sit here for weeks with your one hair brush trying to do that - or you could do it with one stroke with an almighty brush.

Trees grow however makes them happy. We don't have anything but happy trees here. Let's have a nice tree right here. You create the dream - then you bring it into your world. Be so very light. Be a gentle whisper. There are no limits in this world.

Just make a decision and let it go. Let that brush dance around there and play. This is gonna be a happy little seascape. La- da- da- da- dah. Just be happy. Get tough with it, get strong. Work that paint.

If you don't think every day is a good day - try missing a few. You'll see. Let your imagination just wonder around when you're doing these things. Let all these things just sort of happen.

Just pretend you are a whisper floating across a mountain. It's all a game of angles. Put your feelings into it, your heart, it's your world. You can do anything your heart can imagine. Little short strokes.

  <h2>Sort employees using Comparator</h2>
  <p>
    In a previous task, we implemented our own sorting algorithm to sort an array of int values. When it comes to
    sorting numeric values, and even string values, sorting can be pretty straightforward. However, there are many
    occasions where we may need to sort a collection of objects that have no natural ordering. To do this we need to
    leverage either the <code>Comparator</code> or <code>Comparable</code> interface. This task will have us focus on
    the former.
  </p>
  <p>
    This task is more involved than previous ones, as you will need to implement logic across three provided classes.
    The first part of this task will require that you provide an implementation of an Employee object. Please refer to
    the provided image for assistance with implementing this class. The <code>Employee</code> class should implement the
    POJO design pattern properly.
  </p>

  </p>
  <p>
    After you have implemented the <code>Employee</code> class, you should move on to implementing the
    <code>EmployeeComparator</code> class. If two employees have the same salary, then they should be ordered based upon
    their last names. Once that is complete, you should implement the <code>Task.sortEmployeesBySalary</code> method.

    Once you have implemented a solution, you can hit the <code>Check</code> button below to run your implementation
    against some unit tests provided by your trainer.

  <p>
    With regard to the <code>Employee</code> class, do not deviate from the implementation details provided to you in
    the image!
  </p>

  <p>
    Remember that POJOs will need appropriately named getters and setters, based upon the private fields of the class.
    As well as overridden <code>hashcode</code>, <code>equals</code>, and <code>toString</code> methods.
  </p>
</div>
<div class="hint">
  <p>
    There are some unit tests that ensure that invalid values cannot be set for the id or salary of the
    <code>Employee</code> class. Be sure to account for this in your constructors and setters.
  </p>
</div>
<div class="hint">
  <p>
    The String class implements the <code>Comparable</code> interface, which may come in handy for you.

    As always, remember to account for your base cases within your task implementation.

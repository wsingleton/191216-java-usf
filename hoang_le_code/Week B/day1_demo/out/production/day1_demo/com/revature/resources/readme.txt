The very fact that you're aware of suffering is enough reason to be overjoyed that you're alive and can experience it. Work on one thing at a time. Don't get carried away - we have plenty of time. These little son of a guns hide in your brush and you just have to push them out. You better get your coat out, this is going to be a cold painting. Let's just drop a little Evergreen right here. Very easy to work these to death.

Let's go up in here, and start having some fun We might as well make some Almighty mountains today as well, what the heck. Mountains are so simple, they're hard. I'm going to mix up a little color. Weâ€™ll use Van Dyke Brown, Permanent Red, and a little bit of Prussian Blue.

We'll lay all these little funky little things in there. That's crazy. Steve wants reflections, so let's give him reflections.

No worries. No cares. Just float and wait for the wind to blow you around. Everybody needs a friend. These trees are so much fun. I get started on them and I have a hard time stopping.

Put light against light - you have nothing. Put dark against dark - you have nothing. It's the contrast of light and dark that each give the other one meaning. You don't have to be crazy to do this but it does help. There's not a thing in the world wrong with washing your brush. Play with the angles. Let's put some happy little clouds in our world.

This piece of canvas is your world. This painting comes right out of your heart. Maybe there's a little something happening right here.

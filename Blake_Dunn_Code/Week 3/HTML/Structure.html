    The DOCTYPE directive should be the very first non-comment line
    declared within our HTML documents (even before the <html> tag). 

    It is not technically a tag, but a directive, or an instruction 
    to web browser about what version of HTML the page is written in.

                Contains information about the page, rather than the content
                shown (aka metadata). We can include some information, such as:

                    - <style>   :used to apply internal CSS styling to the webpage
                    - <link>    :used for linking external rsources to this document (external CSS)            
                    - <script>  :used to include JS, which can make our webpage more dynamic/interactive
                    - <meta>    :used to provide search engine robots extra info about our page (SEO)
                    - <title>   :used to provide a title for the webpage, which appears in the tab

            HTML tags/elements

                Used to indicate how content should be displayed. Usually will require an opening
                and a closing tag. Those that do not require closing tags are known as "self-closing"
                tags.

                <p>     : paragraph
                <h#>    : headings (range from 1-6; 1 being the largest)
                <div>   : division/divider; used to group related elements together
                <img>   : image (self-closing)
                <a>     : anchor/hyperlink; used to create links to other webpages, or sections within the current page
                <br>    : line break (self-closing)
                <hr>    : horizontal rule (self-closing)
                <form>  : similar to <div>, but will encapsulate form elements/members
                <input> : creates a field for user input of some sort [text, checkbox, rediobutton, etc.] (self-closing)

            
            Attributes

                HTML elements can have attributes, which provide additional information about the contents of an
                element. They appear within the opening tags of an HTML element, and are made of two parts: a 
                name/key, and a value. The name and the value are separated by an equals sign (=) and the value 
                of the attribute is encapsulated within double quotes ("").

        <h1> This is the main heading</h1>
        <p>
            This text might be used to introduce the rest of the page. If the page is long enough,



            we can make use of subheadings to further 
            organize our web pages's content.

            Escape characters/codes

                There are some characters that are used in and reserved by HTML. If we wish to use them
                in our content, we will need to use their escape code equivalents:

                    >   - Greater than      - &gt;

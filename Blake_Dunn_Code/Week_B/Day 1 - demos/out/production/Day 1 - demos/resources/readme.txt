I guess that would be considered a UFO. A big cotton ball in the sky. Look at them little rascals. That's the way I look when I get home late; black and blue. Think about a cloud. Just float around and be there. How to paint. That's easy. What to paint. That's much harder. I'm a water fanatic. I love water.

There isn't a rule. You just practice and find out which way works best for you. Use your imagination, let it go. Put light against light - you have nothing. Put dark against dark - you have nothing. It's the contrast of light and dark that each give the other one meaning.

Fluff that up. That's a crooked tree. We'll send him to Washington. Isn't that fantastic that you can create an almighty tree that fast? Isn't it great to do something you can't fail at? So often we avoid running water, and running water is a lot of fun.

There he comes. Just pretend you are a whisper floating across a mountain. Fluff it up a little and hypnotize it. We'll put a happy little sky in here. Let's build an almighty mountain. If you don't think every day is a good day - try missing a few. You'll see.

Those great big fluffy clouds. We don't make mistakes we just have happy little accidents. And maybe, maybe, maybe... Let's put some happy little bushes on the other side now. I'm gonna add just a tiny little amount of Prussian Blue.

Let's have a happy little tree in here. I will take some magic white, and a little bit of Vandyke brown and a little touch of yellow. Zip. That easy. We're not trying to teach you a thing to copy. We're just here to teach you a technique, then let you loose into the world. Play with the angles.

Maybe there was an old trapper that lived out here and maybe one day he went to check his beaver traps, and maybe he fell into the river and drowned. All you need to paint is a few tools, a little instruction, and a vision in your mind. I started painting as a hobby when I was little. I didn't know I had any talent. I believe talent is just a pursued interest. Anybody can do what I do.

  <h2>Remove spaces from string</h2>
  <p>
    Working with Strings is a huge part of being a developer. In fact, its probably the most used class in all of the
    Java language (don't quote me on that lol). This task serves as another opportunity to get familiar with the String
    API.
  </p>
  <p>
    Your task is to simply remove all of the spaces from a provided string. There are no constraints associated with
    this task.

If these lines aren't straight, your water's going to run right out of your painting and get your floor wet. If you don't think every day is a good day - try missing a few. You'll see. Don't kill all your dark areas - you need them to show the light. It's beautiful - and we haven't even done anything to it yet. There's nothing wrong with having a tree as a friend. Imagination is the key to painting.

It just happens - whether or not you worried about it or tried to plan it. And maybe a little bush lives there. From all of us here, I want to wish you happy painting and God bless, my friends. I'll go over the colors one more time that we use: Titanium white, Thalo green, Prussian blue, Van Dyke brown, Alizarin crimson, Sap green, Cad yellow, and Permanent red.

Work that paint. Everyone is going to see things differently - and that's the way it should be. We don't make mistakes we just have happy little accidents. It's life. It's interesting. It's fun.

Let's put some happy trees and bushes back in here. I'm going to mix up a little color. Weâ€™ll use Van Dyke Brown, Permanent Red, and a little bit of Prussian Blue. That's crazy. We tell people sometimes: we're like drug dealers, come into town and get everybody absolutely addicted to painting. It doesn't take much to get you addicted.

There comes a nice little fluffer. You create the dream - then you bring it into your world. I'm a water fanatic. I love water. A big strong tree needs big strong roots. Steve wants reflections, so let's give him reflections. Isn't that fantastic?

There we are. Let's do that again. Only eight colors that you need.

Just use the old one inch brush. The only prerequisite is that it makes you happy. If it makes you happy then it's good. Follow the lay of the land. It's most important. You are only limited by your imagination. The secret to doing anything is believing that you can do it. Anything that you believe you can do strong enough, you can do. Anything. As long as you believe.

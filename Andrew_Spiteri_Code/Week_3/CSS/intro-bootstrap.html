        What is Bootstrap?
            Bootstrap is a free front-end framework for faster and easier web development.  It invludes HTML and
            CSS based design templates for typography, forms, buttons, tables, bavigation, modals, image carousel,
            and many other components/features.  Additionally, it has optional JS, Popper.js, and JQuery libraries
            that can be leveraged to increase the dynamic behavior of our web pages.

            One of th emain benefits of using Bootstrap oi==us its ability to faciliatate the creatuioin of responsive 
            webpages.   Responsiveness refers to the webpage's ability to maintain proper latyoyt even when viewed
            on varous screen sizes and resolutions.  THis is accomplished by the application of the Bootstrap Grid 
            System (12 columns.)

        What is the Bootstrap CDN
            BootstrapCDN is a public content delivery networl.  Users of Bootstrap can load CSS and JS libs 
            remotely from a hlobal network of servers.  THis way users can fetch the data with low latency,
            regardless of their location.

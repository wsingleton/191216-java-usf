## Defining Microservices

A microservice is an engineering approach focused on decomposing applications into single-function modules with well-defined interfaces which are independently deployed and operated by small teams who own the entire lifecycle of the service.

- Can be described as:
  - an architectural style of developing application
  - an alternative to more traditional 'monolithic' applications
  - decomposition of a single system into a suite of small services, each running as an independent process and intercommunicating via open protocols

- Features of these services:
  - separately written, deployed, scaled, and maintained
  - encapsulate business capability
  - independently replaceable and upgradable
	
- Microservices are not:
  - the same as Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)
    - SOA is about integrating various enterprise applications
    - Microservices are mainly about decomposing single applications
			
  - a panacea to all application development problems
    - The microservices approach has its own drawbacks and risks

- Examples of industry leaders who are using the microservices architecture style for their platforms:
  - Netflix: moved from a Java monolith to Microservices
  - Twitter: moved from a Ruby on Rails monolith to Microservices
  - Facebook: moved from a PHP monolith to Microservices

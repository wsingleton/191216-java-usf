Apache Tomcat? -> a HTTP web server environment for pure java-> Java code 
		packaged within a web archive file (WAR)
		->Services include -> Several Jakarta EE specifications,
				Java Servlet,JavaServer Pages,Java EL,
				WebSocket.

Web Server? Software that can process the client request and send a response
	back to the client. TomCat is the most popular....
	Other examples -> Apache tomcat, Apache Geronimo, Red Hat WildFly,
			Eclipse Jetty, Niginx

Web Client? Software that helps in communicating with the server. We request
	something from the server(URL), web client creates the request sends
	to the server, then it receives the response from the server, parsing
	the response and presents it to the user.
	examples -> Chrome, Firefox, Safari etc


Components of Tomcat?
	Catalina, Coyote, Jasper

	Catalina---> Tomcats servlet container for servlet and 
			javaServer pages(JSP)

	Coyote---> A connector component for tomCat->supports HTTP 1.1 protocol
			as web Server. It allows catalina to act as a web server
			that serves local files as HTTP docs
			
		---> Coyote listens for incoming connects to the server on a 
			specific tcp port and forwards the request to the tomcat
			engine to process the request and send back a response to
			the requesting client. CoyoteJK forwards its requests
			to another web server apache. helps with performance.

	Jasper ---> Tomcats JSP engine. Jasper parses JSP files to compile them into java
			codes as servlets(handled by catalina). Jasper recompiles JSP files
			at runtime.


Deployment Descriptor --> A deployment descriptor refers to a configuration file for an artifact that is 
			deployed to some container/engine. Describes how a component, module or 
			application should be deployed. It directs a deployment tool to deploy a module
			or application with specific container options, security settings/specific 
			configuration requirements. XML syntax used for descriptor files. for web apps
			deployment descriptor called web.xml ->must be in the WEB-INF directory


Annotations ---> Since javax.servlet API version 3, XML configuration for servlet containers is optional.
			Annotations to servlet registration/configuration simplifies the process by 
			allowing developers the ability to configure their servlets and filters using 
			annotations in place of the former xml configuration. Web.xml is required
			to be present
			eg of annotations
			@WebServlet->declare a servlet->servlet available at specified URL pattern
			
			@WebInitParam->Used on a servlet or filter implementation class to specify an 
					initialization parameter

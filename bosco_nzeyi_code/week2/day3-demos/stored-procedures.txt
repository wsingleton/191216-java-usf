STORED PROCEDURES VS STORED FUNCTIONS
-------------------------------------

STORED PROCEDURES
---------------
- used to perform a task
- may or may not return a value
- error handling is possible
- DML + DDL operations are supported. 
- can be used to fire off triggers
- can call / make stored functions
- cannot be used within SLECT, WHERE, or HAVING CLAUSES. 
- Cn have in, out, and/ or IN / OUT procedures. 

STORED FUNCTIONS
----------------

- Used to compute a value
- Must have a return value
- Error handling is not possible 
- DDL + DML ops are not supported. 
- Cannot fire off triggers
- cannot be used independently
- can be used within SELECT, WHERE, & HAVING CLAUSES. 
- Only uses IN parameters. 

Parameter types
----------------

IN = Input
OUT = Output
IN/OUT = Input / Output

PL/SQL = Procedural Language extension of SQL
---------------------------------------------
Advantages: 
	- Block structures
	- Procedural language constraints (loops, conditionals, exception handling)
	- better performance.

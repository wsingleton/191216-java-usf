        <img src=" assets/images/bird-of-paradise-flower.jpg" alt="Bird of Paradise Flower" width="100" height="100">
        <p>Strelitzia, whose common name is the bird of paradise flower, because of a resemblance of its flowers
            to birds-of-paradise (Paradisaea raggiana). The species S. nicolai is the largest in the genus, reaching
            10m tall, with stately white and blue flowers; the other species typically reach 2-3.5m tall, except
            S. caudata which is a tree of a typically smaller size than S. nicolai. The leaves are large, 30–200cm
            long and 10–80cm broad, similar to a banana leaf in appearance but with a longer petiole, and arranged
            strictly in two ranks to form a fan-like crown of evergreen foliage. The flowers are produced in a
            horizontal inflorescence emerging from a stout spathe.</p>

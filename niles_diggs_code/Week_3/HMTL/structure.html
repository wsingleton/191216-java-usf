    web browser about what version of HTML the page is written in.

                Used to indicate how content should be displayed. Usually will require an oppening and closing tag.
                Those that do not require closing tags are known as "slef-closing" tags.

                HTML elementst can have attributes, which providea additional information about the contents of an element.
                They appear within the opening tags of an HTML element, and asre made of two parts: a name/key, and value.
                The name and the value are separated by an equals sign and the value of the attribute is encapsulated within

        <h1>This is the main heading</h1>
        <p>This text migh be used to introduce the rest of the page. If the page is long enough, we can make use of our 
            subheadings to futher organize our web page's content.
        </p>

        <h2>This is a subheading</h2>
        <p>     
            More content could go here if had any...

            Escape character/codes notes

            There are some characters that are used and reserved by HTML. If we wish to use them in our contect, we will need ot use their
            escape code equivalents followed by the semi-colon:

            <
            >
            &
            ""
            single space

        <h1>Iframe</h1>
        <p>
            An iframe is like a little window that has been placed into your webpage. The term "iframe" is an abbreviation for "inline frame"
        </p>

            One common use of iframes is to embed google maps into the webpage. The content of iframe can be to any HTML page
            (which can be located either externally or locally on our machine/webs server)
        </p>

            Another common  use of iframes is to embed viedos into a page. Youtube provides exceelent support for getting the
            iframe regarding any video you wish to embed into your webpage.

            Using iframes works fine when we have an externally hosted video. However, if I hvae my own video content that is
            located on the web server as this document, thenwe will use the html5 &lt;video&gt; tag to accomplish this

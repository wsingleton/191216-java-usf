         what is bootstrap?
    
        Bootstrap is a free front-end framework for faster and easier web developmepnt. It includes HTML and CSS based design templates for
        typography, forms, buttons, tables, navigation and modals, image carosels, and many other componenets/features. Additionally, it has
        optional JavaScript, Popper.js, and  jQuery librae=ries that can be levereged to increase the dynamic behavoir of our web pages.

        One of the main benefits of using Bootstrap is its ability to facilitate the creation of responsive webpages. Responsiveness refers
        to the webpage's ability to maintian proper layout even when viewed on various screen sizes and resolutions. This accomplished by
        the application of the Bootstrap Grid System (12 Columns).


    What is BootstrapCDN

        BookstrapCDN is a public content delivery network. USers of Bootsrap can load CSS and JavaScript libraries remotely from a global
        network of servers. This way users can fetch the data with low latency, regardless of their geographic location.

    
    What is Unobstrusive JavaScript?
        This is loading all of the JavaScript at the end of your page rather than at the beginning. Doing this allows the webpage to load
        faster in the beginning. Better for user responsiveness. No one likes going to a webpage and it taking forever to load.

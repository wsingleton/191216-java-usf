Continuous Integration Delivery Deployment

	- what is it

Continuous Integration 
	- build -> unit tests -> deploy to stage -> acceptance tests
	

vs Continuous Delivery 
	- you need to have good CI in order to have good CD
	build -> unit tests -> deploy to stage -> acceptance tests -> deploy to production
	
	- setting up the correct environment

vs Continuous Deployment

	- build -> unit tests -> deploy to stage -> acceptance tests -> deploy to production

	the last step is set to deploy automatically, double-edged sword as improving devOps 
		when things are not working, or things get broken

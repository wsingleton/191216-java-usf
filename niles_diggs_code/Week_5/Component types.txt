App.tsx
	
	route -> login
	route -> reimbursment 
	route -> users

One component that uses state, get and manage all of the data

stateful			
smart				
controller 			
container 
------------------------------------------------------
Many components with no state, take data for one object, configure the display
all data from props

	- these are faster because they have an implementation of should component update
stateless
dumb (components that dont care about state or where the data comes from)
view
functional	
display
pure

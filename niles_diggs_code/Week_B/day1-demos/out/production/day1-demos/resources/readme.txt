How to paint. That's easy. What to paint. That's much harder. Here we're limited by the time we have. We need dark in order to show light. Don't fiddle with it all day.

Let's make some happy little clouds in our world. I started painting as a hobby when I was little. I didn't know I had any talent. I believe talent is just a pursued interest. Anybody can do what I do. I get carried away with this brush cleaning. Volunteering your time; it pays you and your whole community fantastic dividends. Those great big fluffy clouds. You can get away with a lot.

Don't hurry. Take your time and enjoy. It's beautiful - and we haven't even done anything to it yet. But they're very easily killed. Clouds are delicate. Just let these leaves jump off the brush You got your heavy coat out yet? It's getting colder.

I'm a water fanatic. I love water. Use what happens naturally, don't fight it. Talent is a pursued interest. That is to say, anything you practice you can do. You can do anything here. So don't worry about it. Just pretend you are a whisper floating across a mountain. When things happen - enjoy them. They're little gifts.

As trees get older they lose their chlorophyll. Just think about these things in your mind and drop em' on canvas. You can work and carry-on and put lots of little happy things in here. Let's make a nice big leafy tree. Happy painting, God bless.

Now it's beginning to make a little sense. Isn't it great to do something you can't fail at? We don't have anything but happy trees here. If you didn't have baby clouds, you wouldn't have big clouds. There he comes. Once you learn the technique, ohhh! Turn you loose on the world; you become a tiger.

It's a very cold picture, I may have to go get my coat. Itâ€™s about to freeze me to death. Making all those little fluffies that live in the clouds. A big strong tree needs big strong roots.

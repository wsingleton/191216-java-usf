This is unplanned it really just happens. You don't have to be crazy to do this but it does help. Making all those little fluffies that live in the clouds.

It's a good way of getting rid of all your anxieties and hostilities. Only eight colors that you need. Trees live in your fan brush, but you have to scare them out. If we're going to have animals around we all have to be concerned about them and take care of them. The light is your friend. Preserve it. Once you learn the technique, ohhh! Turn you loose on the world; you become a tiger.

Let's build some happy little clouds up here. Even the worst thing we can do here is good. We'll have a super time. The secret to doing anything is believing that you can do it. Anything that you believe you can do strong enough, you can do. Anything. As long as you believe.

Get tough with it, get strong. You can create anything that makes you happy. Don't be afraid to make these big decisions. Once you start, they sort of just make themselves.

I guess that would be considered a UFO. A big cotton ball in the sky. Put it in, leave it alone. We'll put some happy little leaves here and there. This is the way you take out your flustrations.

I will take some magic white, and a little bit of Vandyke brown and a little touch of yellow. You can create the world you want to see and be a part of. You have that power. Nice little clouds playing around in the sky.

Didn't you know you had that much power? You can move mountains. You can do anything. You better get your coat out, this is going to be a cold painting. The shadows are just like the highlights, but we're going in the opposite direction. Every single thing in the world has its own personality - and it is up to you to make friends with the little rascals. The least little bit can do so much. We must be quiet, soft and gentle.

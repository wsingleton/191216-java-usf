    Determine if a number is even or odd

    Ok, so this one should be a no-brainer, but we'll put it in anyway just to make sure you aren't over thinking your implementations.
    For this task, simply return a string that states "even" or "odd", based upon the value that is provided to the method.
    Once you have implemented a solution, you can hit the Check button below to run your implementation against some unit tests
     provided by your trainer.

        if (val % 2 == 0) {
            System.out.println("The number is even.");
        }
        else {
            System.out.println("The number is odd.");
        }

If it's not what you want - stop and change it. Don't just keep going and expect it will get better. Let's make some happy little clouds in our world. There's nothing wrong with having a tree as a friend.

Give him a friend, we forget the trees get lonely too. Let's make a happy little mountain now. This is the way you take out your flustrations. I thought today we would make a happy little stream that's just running through the woods here.

We can fix anything. You want your tree to have some character. Make it special. I want everbody to be happy. That's what it's all about. There is immense joy in just watching - watching all the little creatures in nature.

And just raise cain. So often we avoid running water, and running water is a lot of fun. You can create anything that makes you happy. Put your feelings into it, your heart, it's your world.

A big strong tree needs big strong roots. Here's something that's fun. Let's put some happy trees and bushes back in here.

In this world, everything can be happy. Everything is happy if you choose to make it that way. The only thing worse than yellow snow is green snow. You got your heavy coat out yet? It's getting colder. You can do anything here - the only pre-requisite is that it makes you happy.

Fluff that up. There are no mistakes. You can fix anything that happens. That's a crooked tree. We'll send him to Washington.

  <h2>Implement a stack</h2>
  <p>
    The stack is one of the most commonly used data structures in software development. This data structure follows the
    First In, First Out principal. This means that, much like a <em>stack</em> of plates, only the most recently added
    item is retrieved from the stack when using either the <code>pop()</code> or <code>peek()</code> methods of
    the instance.
  </p>
  <p>
    Your task is to implement the logic behind the standard stack methods: <code>push()</code>, <code>pop()</code>,
    <code>peek()</code>, and <code>size()</code>. The stack should grow at a rate of one when elements are pushed into
    the stack when it is already at capacity; there is no need to decrease the size of the stack when elements are
    popped off of the structure.

    Once you have implemented a solution, you can hit the <code>Check</code> button below to run your implementation
    against some unit tests provided by your trainer.

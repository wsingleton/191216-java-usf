  <h2>Implement a sorting algorithm</h2>
  <p>
    Although there are multiple libraries available which allow developers to quickly and easily sort data within some
    structure, it is common to be asked to implement a custom sorting algorithm during a coding challenge when
    interviewing with potential employers.
  </p>
  <p>
    Your task is to sort a given array of integers from smallest to largest. You are <em>not</em> allowed to use any
    native or third-party libraries to accomplish this task - it must be your own custom implementation.
  </p>
  <p>
    Once you have implemented a solution, you can hit the <code>Check</code> button below to run your implementation
    against some unit tests provided by your trainer.
  </p>

  <p>
    Notice that the instructions didn't say that any particular sorting algorithm had to be implemented, so the
    implementation you choose is up to you!

    Remember that most efficient solution is not necessarily the best one to implement during a coding challenge.
    Make your primary goal to achieve the minimum viable product (MVP) by implementing the simplest solution that passes
    all of the test cases. Although, you should be prepared to talk about how you could improve your code if you are
    asked.

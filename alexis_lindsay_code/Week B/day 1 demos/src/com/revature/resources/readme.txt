Get away from those little Christmas tree things we used to make in school. Brown is such a nice color. When you buy that first tube of paint it gives you an artist license. You can do anything here. So don't worry about it.

We'll have a super time. Isn't that fantastic? A big strong tree needs big strong roots. I like to beat the brush. Trees cover up a multitude of sins. We want to use a lot pressure while using no pressure at all.

Look around, look at what we have. Beauty is everywhere, you only have to look to see it. I can't think of anything more rewarding than being able to express yourself to others through painting. If you hypnotize it, it will go away. Trees get lonely too, so we'll give him a little friend. Just pretend you are a whisper floating across a mountain.

We'll do another happy little painting. Happy painting, God bless. You can bend rivers. But when I get home, the only thing I have power over is the garbage. Making all those little fluffies that live in the clouds.

Use what happens naturally, don't fight it. There's nothing wrong with having a tree as a friend. Just let these leaves jump off the brush

We need dark in order to show light. The only thing worse than yellow snow is green snow. Let's put some happy little bushes on the other side now. That easy.

Now let's put some happy little clouds in here. So often we avoid running water, and running water is a lot of fun. Everything's not great in life, but we can still find beauty in it. Let's have a happy little tree in here. There he comes. Even trees need a friend. We all need friends.

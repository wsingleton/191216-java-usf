        <h1>Bob Ross Lorem Ipsum</h1>
        <p>Trees live in your fan brush, but you have to scare them out. Let your heart take you to wherever you want to be. I guess that would be considered a UFO. A big cotton ball 
            in the sky.</p>
        <p>Maybe, just to play a little, we'll put a little tree here. We'll put all the little clouds in and let them dance around and have fun. There is no right or wrong - as long 
            as it makes you happy and doesn't hurt anyone. Everything's not great in life, but we can still find beauty in it.</p>
        <p>Let's go up in here, and start having some fun I spend a lot of time walking around in the woods and talking to trees, and squirrels, and little rabbits and stuff. We have 
            no limits to our world. We're only limited by our imagination. Fluff it up a little and hypnotize it. Zip. That easy.</p>
        <p>There we are. That's what painting is all about. It should make you feel good when you paint. By now you should be quite happy about what's happening here.</p>
        <p>Trees grow however makes them happy. It's life. It's interesting. It's fun. All those little son of a guns. This is unplanned it really just happens. This is your creation 
            - and it's just as unique and special as you are.</p>
        <p>Clouds are free. They just float around the sky all day and have fun. Just let these leaves jump off the brush Let's have a nice tree right here. With practice comes 
            confidence. Steve wants reflections, so let's give him reflections. Every highlight needs it's own personal shadow.</p>
        <p>You've got to learn to fight the temptation to resist these things. Just let them happen. That's the way I look when I get home late; black and blue. And right there you 
            got an almighty cloud. That's why I paint - because I can create the kind of world I want - and I can make this world as happy as I want it. That's what makes life fun. 
            That you can make these decisions. That you can create the world that you want. Tree trunks grow however makes them happy&#8253;</p>

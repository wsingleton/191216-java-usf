        <h1>Structural Markup</h1>
        <p>Structural markup only provides structure to the content.</p>
        <h1>Semantic Markup</h1>
        <p>Semantic markup provides additional information on the content enclosed, such as emphasis, quotation indications, or even the meaning of an acronym.</p>

            We start with a vision in our heart, and we put it on canvas. 
            Steve <em>wants</em> reflections, so let's give him reflections.
            Trees get lonely too, so we'll give him a little friend. There
            comes a nice little <del>fluffer</del> <ins>cloud</ins>. Only
            think about&nbsp;one thing at a time. Don't get <strong>greedy</strong>.

                the famous quote from Tom Hanks' character:
                <blockquote>
                    Mama always said, <q>Life is like a box of chocolates.
                    You never know what you're gonna get.</q>

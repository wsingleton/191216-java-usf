Working it up and down, back and forth. If we're gonna walk though the woods, we need a little path. There's nothing
wrong with having a tree as a friend. You can't have light without dark. You can't know happiness unless you've known
sorrow. We don't want to set these clouds on fire. Maybe there's a happy little bush that lives right there.

If you didn't have baby clouds, you wouldn't have big clouds. Every single thing in the world has its own personality -
and it is up to you to make friends with the little rascals. It takes dark in order to show light. Any little thing can
be your friend if you let it be. There is immense joy in just watching - watching all the little creatures in nature. We
touch the canvas, the canvas takes what it wants.

We don't have to be committed. We are just playing here. Let's make a nice big leafy tree. They say everything looks
better with odd numbers of things. But sometimes I put even numbersâ€”just to upset the critics.

It's amazing what you can do with a little love in your heart. You don't want to kill all your dark areas they are very
important. A fan brush is a fantastic piece of equipment. Use it. Make friends with it. That easy. You need the dark in
order to show the light.

Let's build some happy little clouds up here. You gotta think like a tree. Here's something that's fun. If I paint
something, I don't want to have to explain what it is.

We need a shadow side and a highlight side. Let your heart be your guide. You have to make these big decisions. You're
the greatest thing that has ever been or ever will be. You're special. You're so very special.

You can spend all day playing with mountains. You can't make a mistake. Anything that happens you can learn to use - and
make something beautiful out of it. This is a happy place, little squirrels live here and play. That's what painting is
all about. It should make you feel good when you paint. We'll make some happy little bushes here. Don't forget to tell
these special people in your life just how special they are to you.

            HTML tags/elements
                Used to indicate how content should be displayed. Usually
                will require an opening and a closing tag, those that do
                not require closing tags are known as "self-closing" tags.
                <p>     paragraph
                <h#>    headings (range from 1-6, 1 being the largest)
                <div>   division/divider; used to group related elements together
                <img>   image (self-closing)
                <a>     anchor; used to create links to other webpages, or to sections of the current page
                <br>    line break (self-closing)
                <hr>    horizontal rule
                <input> creates a field for user input or some sort of [text, checkbox, etc.] (self-closing)
            Attributes
                    HTML elements can have attributes, which provide additional
                    information about the contents of an element. They appear
                    within the opening tags of an HTML element, and are made of
                    two parts: a name/key, and a value. The name and the value are
                    separated by an equals sign (=). The value of an attribute is 
                    encapsulated within double quotes ("").

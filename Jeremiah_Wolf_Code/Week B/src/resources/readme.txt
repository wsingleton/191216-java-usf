There he comes. In your imagination you can go anywhere you want. I want everbody to be happy. That's what it's all about. If we're going to have animals around we all have to be concerned about them and take care of them. We have all at one time or another mixed some mud.

Just make a decision and let it go. Just make little strokes like that. It's a very cold picture, I may have to go get my coat. Itâ€™s about to freeze me to death. Just a little indication. Play with the angles. Mix your color marbly don't mix it dead.

You want your tree to have some character. Make it special. The light is your friend. Preserve it. This is a fantastic little painting. Just take out whatever you don't want. It'll change your entire perspective. We don't want to set these clouds on fire.

We'll take a little bit of Van Dyke Brown. Exercising the imagination, experimenting with talents, being creative; these things, to me, are truly the windows to your soul. Just go back and put one little more happy tree in there.

Talent is a pursued interest. That is to say, anything you practice you can do. I guess that would be considered a UFO. A big cotton ball in the sky. Only think about one thing at a time. Don't get greedy.

Don't hurry. Take your time and enjoy. If there's two big trees invariably sooner or later there's gonna be a little tree. Go out on a limb - that's where the fruit is. This is unplanned it really just happens.

This present moment is perfect simply due to the fact you're experiencing it. Don't forget to tell these special people in your life just how special they are to you. I really believe that if you practice enough you could paint the 'Mona Lisa' with a two-inch brush. Each highlight must have it's own private shadow.

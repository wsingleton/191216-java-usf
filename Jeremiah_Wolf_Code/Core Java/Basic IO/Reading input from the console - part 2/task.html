  <h2>Reading input from the console (with <code>Scanner</code>)</h2>
  <p>
    As you will quickly find out, in programming - like life - there are often times multiple ways to solve a single
    problem. The task of reading from the console is no exception to this. We saw in the last task how we could read
    from the console using the <code>BufferedReader</code> class, with a little help from the <code>InputStreamReader</code>
    class. Next, we will work on accomplishing the same task, but using the <code>Scanner</code> class.
  </p>
  <p>
    Your task is the same as before, write an implementation which prompts the user from some input. This time, ask the
    user for some integer value using the <code>Scanner</code> class and return the provided value.
  </p>
  <p>Once you have implemented a solution, you can hit the <code>Check</code> button below to run your implementation
    against some unit tests provided by your trainer.</p>

    You will notice that the <code>Scanner</code> class has <em>a lot</em> methods that could be used to read from the
    console. Be sure to choose the method that best fits the needs of this task.

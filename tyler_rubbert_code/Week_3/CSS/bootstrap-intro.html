        What is Bootstrap?

            Bootstrap is a free front-end framework for faster and easier web developement. It includes HTML and
            CSS based design templates for typography,forms, buttons, tables, navigation, modals, image carousels,
            and many other components/features. Additionally, it has optional JavaScript, Popper.js, and jQuery
            libraries that can be leveraged to increase the dynamic behaviour of our web pages.

            one of the main benefits of using Bootstrap is its ability to facilitate the creation of responsive
            webpages. Responsiveness refers to a webpage's ability to maintain proper layout even when viewed 
            on various screen sizes and resolutions. This is accomplished by the application of the Bootstrap
            Grid System (12 columns).

        What is the BootstrapCDN?

            BootstrapCDN is a pulbic content delivery network. Users of Bootstrap can load CSS and JavaScript
            libraries remotely from a global network of servers. This way users can fetch the data with low 
            latency, regardless of their geographic location.

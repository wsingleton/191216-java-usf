    The DOCTYPE directive should be the very first non-comment line
    declared within our HTML documents (even before the <html> tag).

    It is not technically a tag, but a directive, or an instruction
    to web browser about what version of HTML the page is written in.

                shown (aka metadata).  We can include some information such as:

                    - <link>    : used for linking external resources to this documnet (external CSS)
                    - <script>  : used to include JS, which can make our webpage more dynamic/interative 
                    - <meta>    : used to provide search engine robots extra info about our page (SEO)
                    - <title>   : used to provide a title for the webpage, which appears in the tab

            HTML tags/elements

                Used to indicate how content should be displayed.  Usually will require an opening 
                and a closing tag.  Those that do not require closing tags are known as "self-closing"
                tags.

                <p>     : paragraph
                <h#>    : headings (range from 1-6; 1 being the largest)
                <div>   : division/divider; used to group related elements together
                <img>   : image (self-closing)
                <a>     : anchor/hyperlink; used to create links to other webpages, or to sections within the current page
                <br>    : line break (self-closing)
                <hr>    : horizontal rule (self-closing)
                <form>  : similar to <div>, but will encapsulate form elements/members
                <input> : creates a field for user input of some sort [text, checkbox, radio button, ect.] (self-closing)


            Attributes
                    
                HTML elements can have attributes, which provide additional information about the contents of an
                element. They appear within the opening tags of an HTML element, and are made of two parts: a
                name/key, and a value. The name and the value are separated by an equals sign (=) and the value 
                of the attribute is encapsulated within double quotes ("").

        <h1>This is the main heading</h1>
        <p>
            This text might be used to introduce the rest of the page. If the page is long enough,





            we can make use of subheadings to further
            organize our web page's content.

        </p>

        <h2>This is a sub-heading</h2>

            More content could go here if had any...

            Escape characters/codes

                There are some characters that are used in and reserved by HTML. If we wish to use
                them in our content, we will need to use their escape code equivalents:

                    >   - Greater-than      -   &gt;    &#61;

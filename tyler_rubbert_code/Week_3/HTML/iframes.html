        <h1>Iframes</h1>
        <p>
            An iframe is like a little window taht has been placed into your
            webpage. The term "iframe" is an abbreviateion for "inline frame".
        </p>

        <p>
            One common use of iframes is to embed Google Maps into the webpage.
            The content of the iframe can be to an HTML page(which can be 
            located either externally or locally on our machine/web server)
        </p>

        <iframe src="https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m18!1m12!1m3!1d174622.112409228!2d-96.96859708387123!3d46.854112456273974!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x52c8cb8d84677145%3A0x81aa30a52791aaca!2sFargo%2C%20ND!5e0!3m2!1sen!2sus!4v1579021139695!5m2!1sen!2sus" 
        width="600" height="450" frameborder="0" style="border:0;" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>"

        <p>
            Another common use of iframes is to embed videos into a page.
            Youtube provies excellent support for getting the iframe info
            regarding any video you wish to embed into your webpage.
        </p>

        <p>
            Using iframes works just fine when we have an externally hosted video.  However,
            if I have my own video content that is located on the web server as this document,
            then the HTML5 &lt;video&gt; tag to accomplish this.

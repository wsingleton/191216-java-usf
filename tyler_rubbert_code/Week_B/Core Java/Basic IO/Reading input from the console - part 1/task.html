  <h2>Reading input from the console (with <code>BufferedReader</code>)</h2>
  <p>
    As we saw in the first task, printing text to the console is pretty straightforward - especially
    with the <code>System</code> class at our disposal. Next, we move on to reading from the console.
  </p>
  <p>
    In order to accomplish this task you will again be making use of the <code>System</code> class, but you will also
    need to use the <code>BufferedReader</code> member included in the Task class declaration to allow you to read from
    an input stream (in this case, the console). Provide an implementation that will prompt the user for input and
    return their response.
  </p>
  <p>
    Once you have implemented a solution, you can hit the <code>Check</code> button below to run your implementation
    against some unit tests provided by your trainer.

  <p>
    Pay close attention to the arguments of the <code>BufferedReader</code>'s constructor. Notice that it needs a
    <code>Reader</code> implementation passed to it. There is an implementation of this abstract class that will help
    you to read from the system's input stream (console).
  </p>
</div>
<div class="hint">
  <p>
    Most of the methods within the <code>BufferedReader</code>'s API throws checked exceptions, so you will be required
    handle these within your implementation.

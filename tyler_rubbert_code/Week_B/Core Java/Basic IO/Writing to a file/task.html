  <h2>Writing to a file</h2>
  <p>
    We have reached the final task within this lesson. In our previous task, we saw how to read text from an existing
    file, and next we will do the opposite: write to a file. This is a very common task that a junior developer should
    be able to accomplish quickly in a programming language of their choice.
  </p>
  <p>
    As mentioned, your task is to write some provided text into a file name <code>write.txt</code>, which should be
    located within a directory called <code>resources</code>. This directory should be a sibling to the <code>src</code>
    directory. The method you will implement will have an array of Strings passed to it, you should right each element
    of this array on a new line within the file.
  </p>
  <p>
    Once you have implemented a solution, you can hit the <code>Check</code> button below to run your implementation
    against some unit tests provided by your trainer.

    There are several ways to accomplish this task. Try using the Java NIO classes to simplify your logic.

    Ensure that the file gets created <em>before</em> attempting to write to it.

  <h2>Reading from a file</h2>
  <p>
    So now we know how to get input from a user from the console. While that is pretty cool, you probably will not find
    yourself needing to do this very often - as a web developer at least. However, something you will find yourself
    doing fairly often is reading the contents of a file and storing them inside of some data structure which is passed
    on for further processing.
  </p>
  <p>
    Your task is to do just that: read the contents of a provided file, store its contents into an array of Strings
    which are returned from the method. If a invalid file is provided, or if the file is empty, then you should return
    an empty array.

    Once you have implemented a solution, you can hit the <code>Check</code> button below to run your implementation
    against some unit tests provided by your trainer.

  <p>
    Arrays in Java cannot be sized dynamically, however there is a useful method within the <code>Arrays</code> utility
    class that you can use to help you get around this inconvenience.

  <h2>Interest calculator</h2>
  <p>
    Your task is to implement a method which will return the appropriate return on investment (ROI) when provided with
    valid values - negative values are not permitted. The returned value should be rounded to two decimal places.
  </p>
  <p>
    Compound interest is calculated using the following formula:

    <br>
    <code>P (1 + R/n)^(nt)</code>
    <br><br>

    Where,
    <ul>
      <li><code>P</code> = initial principal amount.</li>
      <li><code>R</code> = interest rate</li>
      <li><code>n</code> = number of times interest applied per time period</li>
      <li><code>t</code> = number of time periods elapsed</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    Once you have implemented a solution, you can hit the <code>Check</code> button below to run your implementation
    against some unit tests provided by your trainer.

    While there is no basic operator working with exponents, the <code>java.lang.Math</code> class provides some useful
    static methods to help you complete this task.

    There are several different ways that you can round a double to a certain number of decimal places. Since there are
    no constraints on this task, feel free to use whatever implementation you desire.

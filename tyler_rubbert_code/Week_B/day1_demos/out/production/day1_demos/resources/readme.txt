There we go. Absolutely no pressure. You are just a whisper floating across a mountain. There are no mistakes. You can fix anything that happens. You are only limited by your imagination.

This is the fun part We'll throw some old gray clouds in here just sneaking around and having fun. Very easy to work these to death.

But we're not there yet, so we don't need to worry about it. Remember how free clouds are. They just lay around in the sky all day long. This piece of canvas is your world.

You can spend all day playing with mountains. I get carried away with this brush cleaning. You can't make a mistake. Anything that happens you can learn to use - and make something beautiful out of it. It's almost like something out of a fairytale book.

Let's do that again. We might as well make some Almighty mountains today as well, what the heck. This is a happy place, little squirrels live here and play. Let's do it again then, what the heck. We'll put some happy little leaves here and there. Little trees and bushes grow however makes them happy.

Let your imagination just wonder around when you're doing these things. Play with the angles. Of course he's a happy little stone, cause we don't have any other kind. Just make little strokes like that.

Even trees need a friend. We all need friends. You're meant to have fun in life. I guess that would be considered a UFO. A big cotton ball in the sky. You can create anything that makes you happy. With practice comes confidence. At home you have unlimited time.

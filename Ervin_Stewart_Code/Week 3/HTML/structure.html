<!-- this is an HTML comment; it can be multi- line


    the doctype directive should be the very first non-comment line 
    declared within out html documents(even before the <html> tag.)

    it is not technically a tag, but a directive, or an instruction
    to web browser about what version of html the page is written in.

 <!--
            <head> conatins information/ content that will be displayed to the user, when

                HTMLtags/elements
                    used to indicate how content should be displayed. usually will require an opening
                    and a closing tag. those that do not require closing tags are known as self-closing tags.
                    
                    
                    <p> :paragraph
                    <h#>    :headings( range from 1-6; 1 being the largest)
                    <div>   :division/divider; used to group related elements together
                    <img>   :image (self-closing tag)
                    <a>     :anchor/hyperlink used to create inks to other webpages or to 
                        sections withing the current page
                    <br>    :line break(selfClosing)
                    <hr>    :horizontal rule(self closing)
                    <form>  :similar to <div>, but will encapsulate form elements/members
                    <input>   :creates a field for user input of some sort which could be 
                    text, checkbox, radio button, etc. (self closing)

                Attributes
                        HTML elements can have attributes, which provide additional information about the contents of an
                        element. they appear within the opening tags of an HTML element, and are made up of two parts: 
                        a name/key and a value. the name and  the value are separated by an equals sign(=) and the 
                        of the attribute is encapsulated within double quotes
        -->
        <h1> This is the main heading</h1>
        <p>
            This text might be used to introduce the rest of the page. if the page is long enough



            We can make use of subheadings to further organize our web page's content



        </p>
        <h2> This is a sub-heading</h2>
        <p>
            more content could go here if had any...                           
        </p>
        <h3>
            
            This is even smaller than the other headings.. maybe to create nested content</h3>

            <!-- Escape characters/codes
             there are some characters that are used in and reserved by html. if we wish to use them in our 
            content, we will need to use their escape code equivalents:
                <   -Less than  - &lt; - &#60
                >   -greater than - &gt; -&#61

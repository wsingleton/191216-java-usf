        <h1>Iframes</h1>
        <p>
            An iframe is like a little window that has been place into your webpage.
            The term "iframe" and an abbr for "inline frame".
        </p>
        <p>
            One common use of iframes is to embed Google maps into webpage. The content
            of the iframe can be any HTML page (which can be located either externally 
            or locally on out machine/wbeserver)
        </p>

        <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/xVpdYUlfREk" frameborder="0" 
        allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

        <p>
            Using iframes works just fine fro externally hosted video. However, if i have a video
            content that is located on the web server as this document, then we will use the HTML5
            tag
        </p>

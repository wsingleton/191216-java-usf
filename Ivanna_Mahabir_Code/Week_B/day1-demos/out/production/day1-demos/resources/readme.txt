Just go back and put one little more happy tree in there. Maybe, just to play a little, we'll put a little tree here. We can fix anything.

We don't have to be committed. We are just playing here. Isn't it fantastic that you can change your mind and create all these happy things? La- da- da- da- dah. Just be happy. It's all a game of angles. I like to beat the brush. If there's two big trees invariably sooner or later there's gonna be a little tree.

If we're gonna walk though the woods, we need a little path. The least little bit can do so much. It takes dark in order to show light. Maybe there's a happy little Evergreen that lives here.

And maybe, maybe, maybe... There isn't a rule. You just practice and find out which way works best for you. Let's get wild today. Paint anything you want on the canvas. Create your own world. We don't really know where this goes - and I'm not sure we really care. Isn't that fantastic?

A tree cannot be straight if it has a crooked trunk. Let your heart take you to wherever you want to be. In painting, you have unlimited power. You have the ability to move mountains. If you've been in Alaska less than a year you're a Cheechako. Let's do it again then, what the heck.

Don't be afraid to make these big decisions. Once you start, they sort of just make themselves. Look around, look at what we have. Beauty is everywhere, you only have to look to see it. Clouds are free they come and go as they please. If you don't like it - change it. It's your world. Use what happens naturally, don't fight it. Let's build an almighty mountain.

That's the way I look when I get home late; black and blue. It looks so good, I might as well not stop. I thought today we would make a happy little stream that's just running through the woods here. And just raise cain. Let your imagination just wonder around when you're doing these things.
